**A JavaScript Testing Framework**

**This fork of Jasmine provides Auto-refresh checkbox in HTML runner. When enabled page is auto-refreshed 1sec after test suite finishes**

Jasmine is a Behavior Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript. It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Thus it's suited for websites, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.
