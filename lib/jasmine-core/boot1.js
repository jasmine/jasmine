 This file finishes 'booting' Jasmine, performing all of the necessary
 initialization before executing the loaded environment and all of a project's
 specs. This file should be loaded after `boot0.js` but before any project
 source files or spec files are loaded. Thus this file can also be used to
 customize Jasmine for a project.

 If a project is using Jasmine via the standalone distribution, this file can
 be customized directly. If you only wish to configure the Jasmine env, you
 can load another file that calls `jasmine.getEnv().configure({...})`
 after `boot0.js` is loaded and before this file is loaded.
