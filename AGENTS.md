## 🚨 AI Policy & Operations

Extracted from CONTRIBUTING.md - operational constraints and procedures.

### AI Policy

- All source code belongs in `src/`. The `core/` directory contains the bulk of Jasmine's functionality. This code should remain browser- and environment-agnostic. If your feature or fix cannot be, as mentioned above, please degrade gracefully. Any code that depends on a browser (specifically, it expects `window` to be the global or `document` is present) should live in `src/html/`.
- [standard GitHub process](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

### Key Requirements

- [issues tagged help needed](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Ajasmine+label%3A%22help+needed%22+)

### Development Procedures

- should have enough detail to get started.
- Use `npm test` to test in Node.
- Use `npm run serve` to test in browsers.
- 2. Fix any eslint or prettier errors reported at the end of `npm test`. Prettier
- errors can be automatically fixed by running `npm run cleanup`.



## 🏗️ Architecture & Context Guide

This section provides architectural context and agent-understanding for the codebase.

### Prerequisites

- **Javascript:** 16+ (or applicable language version)
- **Package Manager:** npm or yarn
- **Test Runner:** Mocha



### Project Structure

```
jasmine/
├── package.json
├── src/                  # Source code
├── tests/                # Test suite (2 files)
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```

### Architecture Overview

#### Key Components
- **Main Entry:** Standard layout
- **Test Suite:** 2 test files
- **Build Configuration:** package.json

#### Design Principles

1. **Modularity** - Code organized by functionality with clear separation of concerns
2. **Testability** - Comprehensive test coverage across critical paths
3. **Clarity** - Explicit naming and structure for AI agent understanding
4. **Consistency** - Uniform patterns and conventions throughout codebase
5. **Maintainability** - Well-documented code with clear intent

### Directory Map

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| `lib/` | Library code |
| `scripts/` | Build and utility scripts |
| `spec/` | Test specifications |
| `src/` | Source code |


### Development Workflow

#### Initial Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/jasmine.git
cd jasmine
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

#### Development Commands

**Running Tests:**
```bash
npm test                  # Run all tests
npm run test -- --watch   # Watch mode
npm run lint              # Lint code
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
npm run format            # Format code (prettier)
npm run lint -- --fix     # Auto-fix lint issues
```

### Code Style & Conventions

- **Naming:** Use Javascript conventions (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for classes)
- **Type Hints:** Yes (strongly encouraged)
- **Error Handling:** Yes - handle errors at boundaries; let exceptions propagate when another layer owns recovery
- **Logging:** No
- **Testing:** Yes - write tests alongside code changes

### Testing Strategy

**Framework:** Mocha
**Test Files:** 2 found

Before committing:
1. Run the full test suite: `npm test` or `yarn test`
2. Run linter: `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`
3. Format code: `npm run format` or `yarn format`
4. Type check (if TypeScript): `npm run type-check`

### Writing Documentation

When updating docs:
1. Always include explanatory text before code snippets
2. Describe *why* and *what* before showing *how*
3. Keep sections focused on a single concept
4. Use clear, concrete examples

## Known Gotchas & Warnings

- for everyone. If you want to contribute but don't know what to work on,
- _Write specs_ - Jasmine's a testing framework. Don't add functionality

### Contributing Guidelines

This project has a detailed contribution guide at **`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`**.

**Key Requirements:**
- Review the contribution guide for all requirements
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Ensure alignment with project's contribution policies

### Common Patterns

When contributing to this project:
1. Read existing code in the area you're modifying
2. Follow the established patterns and style
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
5. Add docstrings for public APIs
6. Update tests when changing behavior

### What We Value

✅ Well-tested code with clear intent
✅ Consistent code style and naming conventions
✅ Code that is easy for AI agents to understand
✅ Clear, descriptive commit messages
✅ Modular, reusable components
✅ Comprehensive documentation

### What We Avoid

❌ Large functions doing multiple things
❌ Commented-out dead code
❌ Inconsistent naming or patterns
❌ Unclear error messages
❌ Unexplained magic numbers or strings
❌ Skipped tests or test TODOs

### AI Readiness Dimensions (Scoring)

This project is evaluated across 8 dimensions:

1. **Architecture** (10/100) - Code organization and modularity
2. **Testing** (9/100) - Test coverage and quality
3. **Dependencies** (12/100) - Dependency management
4. **Conventions** (8/100) - Consistent patterns
5. **Entry Points** (4/100) - Clear main/start locations
6. **Security** (10/100) - Input validation and error handling
7. **Build** (10/100) - Clear build/setup instructions
8. **Documentation** (8/100) - Code and project documentation

### Next Steps

Before making changes:
1. Read relevant source files to understand the existing code
2. Look at existing tests for similar functionality
3. Follow the patterns you see in the codebase
4. Write tests for your changes
5. Run `pytest` to verify nothing breaks
6. Run code quality checks: `ruff check . && mypy .`
7. Format your code: `ruff format .`
