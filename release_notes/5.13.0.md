# Jasmine Core 5.13.0 Release Notes

## Changes to supported environments

Safari 26 is now supported on a best-effort basis.

Due to the limited availability of Safari 18 and later on free CI services,
Safari support in future jasmine-core versions will be limited to:

* Best-effort support for the latest Safari version available on GitHub Actions,
  which may change at any time.
* Best-effort support for Safari 16 and 17 for as long as it remains practical.

## New Features

* New `extraItStackFrames` and `extraDescribeStackFrames` config options to fix
  the filename properties of reporter events in configurations that wrap
  `it`/`describe`, such as zone.js. The `filename` properties of reporter events
  are no longer deprecated.
* `jasmine.allOf` asymmetric equality tester
  * Merges [#2087](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/2083) from @jonahd-g
  * Fixes [#2083](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/pull/2087)

treated as release blockers.
