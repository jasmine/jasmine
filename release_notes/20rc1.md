# Jasmine Core 2.0 Release Notes

## Summary

These notes are for RC1 of Jasmine Core 2.0.

## Breaking Changes

These changes have breaking interface changes and are not backwards compatible with 1.x.

* New syntax for asynchronous specs
* New syntax for spies
* New interface for reporters
* Better Equality testing
* Easier custom matchers
* Change to `toThrow` matcher

### New syntax for asynchronous specs

Similar to [Mocha][mocha], Jasmine befores, specs, and afters can take an optional "done" callback in order to force asynchronous tests. The next function, whether it's a before, spec or after, will wait until this function is called or if a timeout is reached.

### New syntax for spies

Spies have a slightly modified syntax. The ideas came from a desire to preserve any of the properties on a spied-upon function and some better testing patterns.

### New interface for reporters

The reporter interface has changed. The callbacks are different and more consistent. The objects passed in should only provide what is needed to report results. This enforces an interface to result data so custom reporters will be less coupled to Jasmine implementation. The full suite execution time is also reported.

### Better Equality testing

We have tossed the previous equality code and are now using new code for testing equality. We started with [Underscore.js][underscore]'s `isEqual`, refactored a bit and added some additional tests.

### Easier custom matchers

Custom matchers have always been possible, but this was barely documented and clunky to test. We've changed how matchers are added and tested. Jasmine adds its own matchers by the same mechanism that as custom matchers use. Dogfooding FTW.

### Change to `toThrow` matcher

We've changed the behavior of the `toThrow` matcher, moving some functionality to the `toThrowError` matcher. This should allow more of the requested use cases.

## Other Changes

* Massive refactoring and better testing
* Environment setup now in `boot.js`
* Development & Build moved to Grunt
* Change in how Jasmine is loaded
* Change in how Jasmine is tested
* Better node.js support
* Better Continuous Integration Environment at Travis
* Support matrix updated
* Removed JsDoc Pages

## Massive refactoring and better testing

This is the biggest set of changes. We've touched nearly every file and every object. We've slammed objects back together and pulled out new extractions. We've made the code more consistently styled. We've improved the tests nearly everywhere.

In general, Jasmine is made of smaller, more-loosely-coupled objects, unit-tested with explicit dependencies injected. This made tests easier to write, read, and maintain. We know this has made Jasmine development easier for the core team. We expect (and hope) this makes it easier for the community to extend Jasmine and provide pull requests that make more sense the first time out.

## Environment setup now in `boot.js`

Instantiation and setup of the Jasmine environment, including building reporters, exposing the "global" functions, and executing tests has moved into its own file: `boot.js`. This should make it easier to add custom reporters, configure some objects, or just in general change how you use Jasmine from the outside.

For example, during development, Jasmine uses it's own `devboot.js` to load itself twice - once from `jasmine.js` and once from the source directories.

## Development & Build moved to Grunt

We've moved away from Ruby and embraced Node.js and [Grunt.js][grunt] for the various command line tasks during development. Yes, it's a just a different set of dependencies. But it's less code for the team to maintain - it turns out that JavaScript tools are pretty good at building JavaScript projects. This will make it easier for the community to make sure contributions work in browser and in Node.js before submitting Pull Requests. There is more detail in the [Contributor's Guide][contrib].

## Change in how Jasmine is loaded

We did not want to add new run-time dependencies, yet we needed to be cleaner when loading Jasmine. So we wrote a custom "require" scheme that works in Node.js and in browsers. This only affects pull requests that add files - please be careful in these cases. Again, the [Contributor's Guide][contrib] should help.

## Change in how Jasmine is tested with Jasmine

Writing a custom require system helped enforce self-testing - the built `jasmine.js` testing Jasmine from the source directories. Overall this has improved the stability of the code. When you look at Jasmine's tests, you'll see both `jasmine` and `j$` used. The former, `jasmine`, will always be used to test the code from source, which is loaded into the reference `j$`. Please adhere to this pattern when writing tests for contributions.

## Better node.js support

Node.js is now officially a first-class citizen. For a long time we've made sure tests were green in Node before releasing. But it is now officially part of Jasmine's CI build at [Travis][travis]. For the curious, the [`node_suite.js`][node_suite], is essentially a `boot.js` for Node. An official npm is coming.

## Better Continuous Integration Environment at Travis

The [CI build at Travis][travis_jasmine] now runs the core specs in a build matrix across browsers. It's far from complete on the operating system matrix, but you will see that Jasmine runs against: Firefox, Chrome, Safari 5, Safari 6, Phantom.js, Node.js, and IE versions 8, 9, and 10. Big thanks to [SauceLabs][sauce] for their support of open source projects. We will happily take pull requests for additional OS/Browser combos within the matrix.

## Support Matrix Updated

We're dropping support for IE < 8. Jasmine 1.x remains for projects supporting earlier versions of browsers.

## Removed JsDoc Pages

Comments in code are lies waiting to happen. Jasmine's JsDoc comments were no exception. The comments were out of date, the generated pages were even more out of date, and frankly they were not helpful. So they're gone.

Last year saw the posting of the [`introduction.js`][intro] page to document the real, practical interface for projects to use. This page has received a lot of positive feedback so expect more pages like this one.

There were several other pull requests that either had already been fixed, or were good starting points for the various changes above. Thank you for all of the hard work to keep Jasmine awesome.

## Other Bugs & Features
